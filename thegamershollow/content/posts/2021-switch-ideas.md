So because it is 2021 that means a new year of fun filled excitement about gaming, I am hoping for a switch pro in 2021 and I wanted to talk about that and a few other things involving Nintendo Switch.

  

Apex Legends- is leaked to be coming to switch on febuary second in Japan febuary first in the USA. so we saw a video on YouTube posted by apex Japan and shortly after it was posted the video was taken down and it seemed to be a very strong leak in my opinion.

  

Switch Pro- I and a bunch of other people are hoping for a switch pro with d padded joy-con, 4k when docked, and new and better graphics. comment down below your thoughts on switch pro and what you think it should have.
