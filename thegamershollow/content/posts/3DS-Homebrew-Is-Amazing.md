Homebrew on the 3DS/2DS is amazing, you are able to do so much with the handheld.

### Getting Homebrew onto the 3DS

Go to [3ds.hacks.guide](https://3ds.hacks.guide) and follow the guide there. After that you should have a jailbroken 3DS. Depending on what 3DS you have (2DS, 3DS, n3DS, n2DS, etc.) some homebrew apps might not work properly. 

Now that you have a jailbroken 3DS let's go over the best homebrew for the 3DS. The best site to find 3DS homebrew is [gamebrew.org](https://www.gamebrew.org/wiki/List_of_3DS_homebrew_applications) and [universal-team.net](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/). Below I will list some of the homebrew apps that I recommend.

1. [Universal Updater](https://universal-team.net/projects/universal-updater.html) - Universal updater is basically a homebrew appstore for the 3DS allowing you to download basically any homebrew you need.

2. [Nimbus/Pretendo](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/nimbus) - Nimbus is an app created by the pretendo network team, it allows you to use the replacement for the shutdown nintendo network servers.

3. [Anemone](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/anemone3ds) - Anemone is a theme engine for the 3DS allowing you to use custom themes created by the community

4. [DevilutionX](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/devilutionx) - DevilutionX is an open-source decomp of Diablo 1 made for many platforms.

5. [Space Cadet Pinball](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/3d-pinball---space-cadet) - Space Cadet Pinball from Windows XP ported to the 3ds (and other platforms)

6. [SNES9x](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/snes9x-updated-fork) - an open-source SNES emulator.

7. [Wumiibo](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/wumiibo) - an open-source amiibo image loader.

8. [FBI Reloaded](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/fbi-reloaded) - an open-source addon for FBI the CIA installer

9. [Open AGB Firm](https://db.universal-team.net/3ds/open_agb_firm) - A Luma 3DS firmware module that allows you to load gameboy advance roms.
