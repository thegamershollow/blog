About 3 months ago, I switched to using Linux instead of Mac OS or Windows, because it was more stable and open-source. Since that switch I had been using Linux Mint 22 as my daily driver OS but about a month ago I switched to a distro based on Arch - Endeavour OS - and have loved it since, the freedom of customization the freedom of being able to install almost anything from the AUR and the freedom of open-source software for gaming. 

## Why I Switched

I switched to an Arch based distro for a few reasons; one of the main being the freedom of customization to my hearts content. I liked Linux Mint's cinnamon desktop environment, but I prefer Plasma by the KDE team. When I switched to Endeavor OS KDE 6.0 had just come out with all it's flashy new features and rich customiztion. I prefer the deafault Breeze dark theme with a few customiztion. Like changing the cursor type and so forth.

## Why an Arch Based Distro and not Arch Itself

I chose an Arch-based distro after struggling with Debian on my early 2011 MacBook Pro, where getting WiFi and ports like Thunderbolt and FireWire to work required extensive research and manual modifications. I then tried Arch Linux but faced many installation challenges. To avoid the hassle of setting everything up from scratch, I looked for an Arch-based distro and considered Manjaro, but ultimately couldn't use it due to issues with their team. When I found EndeavourOS, I was pleasantly surprised that all my MacBook's hardware drivers worked out of the box during the live installation, despite the proprietary hardware.
