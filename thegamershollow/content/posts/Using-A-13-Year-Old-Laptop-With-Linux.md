I use a early 2011 Macbook Pro as my daily driver laptop, and it works for what I do, but it could be better. In this post I will overview the pros and cons of using this as my daily driver.

### Pros

- Good battery life
- Can use modern apps
- Has relatively good performance


### Cons
- High temperature when doing normal tasks
- Can't run modern games in high quality
