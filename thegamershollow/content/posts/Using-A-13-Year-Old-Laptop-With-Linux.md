I use a early 2011 Macbook Pro as my daily driver laptop, and it works for what I do, but it could be better. In this post I will overview the pros and cons of using this as my daily driver.

### Pros

- Good battery life
- Can use modern apps
- Has relatively good performance


### Cons
- High temperature when doing normal tasks
- Can't run modern games in high quality

### Why
I use this as my daily driver laptop because it had good battery life, and is an intel based Mac that still supports old versions of Mac OS. 

### Closing

while using a 13 year old laptop can be a disadvantage when it comes to Mac OS support, installing Linux on the laptop was the best decision I made as it only supports up to Mac OS 10.13 (High Sierra).
