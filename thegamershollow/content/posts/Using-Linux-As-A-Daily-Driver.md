Linux, lot's of people use linux as their daily driver OS and I do as well, I use Linux Mint 22 as my daily drive OS in 2024 because it's simple and easy to manage. I also use Linux because I have freedom of customization and installing anything I want to tweak the operating system as a whole.

### Why I Switched

I switched to Linux because I found it to be more open and inviting for the tweaks I wanted to make, Mac OS was very limited in what I could customize and do because of it's secure nature in addition to that i'm using an old Macbook Pro from early 2011 as my daily driver laptop so the latest versions of Mac OS won't run on my laptop so that was another reason for me to switch to linux. 

### What I use

I use Linux Mint as my distro of choice because of it's simplicity and ease of use. I know my way around the Linux terminal but wanted a simple distro that I could use on my laptop that wouldn't take a lot of effort to setup. I didn't want to go with Ubuntu because I hate the snap store and packages, so I went with Linux Mint because it's based on Ubuntu.
