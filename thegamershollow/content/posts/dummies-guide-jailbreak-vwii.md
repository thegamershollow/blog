## Jailbreaking the Virtual Wii

Built in to your Wii U console is a Virtual Wii (vWii) which we can also jailbreak, this is an optional process but doing it will allow you to play Gamcube and Wii game backups, as well as use Wii Homebrew.

To Jailbreak the vWii turn off your Wii U and hold `X` while you turn it on, then scroll down to where it says `vWii Mod Installer`, then press `A`. This will boot you into the Homebrew Launcher (an old version of Homebrew that has to be used to Jailbreak the vWii), navigate to `vWii Compat Installer` and click it, then click load. Once the app loads press `A` to install the `Homebrew Channel`, and wait till it says “Install Complete”. Now turn off your Wii U and Load the Wii app. Once loaded into the Wii menu, launch the channel titled `Homebrew Channel`, this will allow you to access homebrew apps on your Wii.
