## What You Need

- A Wii U with the latest firmware installed (The Wii U can be from any region)
- An SD card or microSD card with an adapter
- A computer to copy files to the SD card
- An internet connection setup on your Wii U

## Setting up The SD Card

Plug the SD card into your computer and format it to FAT-32 a guide on how to do that can be found HERE. After formatting the SD card rename it to something **other than wiiu** as it will not allow you to jailbreak your console if it it names wiiu.

## Getting The Files For The SD Card

To make the process of jailbreaking your console easier we have compiled everything you need to jailbreak your console into a single .zip file which can be downloade [**HERE**](https://github.com/Cal-theDevGirl/Wii-U-Homebrew-Compilation/releases). after you have downloaded the zip file extract it and copy the enclosed folder to your desktop (the folder should be named wiiu-sd-card-compilation) now open the folder named wiiu-sd-card-compilation, select all the files inside it and drag them onto your SD card.

## Jailbreaking the Console

Eject the SD card from your computer and insert the SD card into the Wii U’s SD card slot. Now turn on your Wii U and open the internet browser and go to wiiuexploit.xyz then once on the page click run homebrew launcher and hold the X button until a screen says Environment Loader at the top. If your Wii U freezes in the process, turn it off and delete your internet browser save data then try again.

Once on the Environment Loader screen, navigate to where it says Installer and click A. Then press A on check, and again on Install/Update. Your Wii U console will shutdown, turn it back on and open the Health and Safety Guide while holding X. This will open the environment loader press A on installer again and press A on check, then press A on Boot Options. Then press A on Switch to PayloadLoader. This will allow you to automatically boot into the jailbreak whenever you turn on your Wii U. Your console will have shutdown again, turn it back on, it will boot into the Environment Loader menu scroll down to Aroma and press Y, this will autoboot the Aroma Environment whenever you turn on your console. Now Press A on Aroma to launch the environment. You have now succesfully jailbroken your Wii U and installed Aroma on it, you can now use Homebrew apps and install dumped discs to your console.

## Jailbreaking the Virtual Wii
