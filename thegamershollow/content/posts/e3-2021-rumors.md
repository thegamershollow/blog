So today i will be talking about the E3 rumors. to watch E3 on June 12 to 15th go here [www.e3expo.com](https://e3expo.com/) or look at [youtube.com/channel/UCNy\_lYhgyQAG1KAqv5DRUEw](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNy_lYhgyQAG1KAqv5DRUEw)(this is E3's youtube channel)

if you any of you have ideas/thoughts about what things are going to be announced then put them in the comment section below.

  

I think that breath of the wild 2 will be announce and they will give a release date, i also think the switch pro will be announced and will have preorders up on that day and it will release on august 1st with a price of $399.99 USD. i also think that Microsoft will put X-box gamepass on switch(it is not very likely but that is  what i would like to happen.). Nintendo will also add master chief to smash bros. even though playstation is not at E3 i think they will still give us some news on horizon zero down 2. i think X-Box will announce halo infinite to be released holiday 2021, i think nintendo will push updates to all their online games to run online like Monster hunter rise. i think we will get remasters of golden eye and a lot of the N64/ gamecube games on the nintendo switch. if you have any other rumors put them in the comment section below
