We Heard about this 2017 it is now May of 2021.

we(the fans of the Metroid series ) have been waiting for this since they announced it at e3 2017, they have given us even more information on it since than though. Nintendo has said that The dev team for Metroid prime 4 messed up and is remaking the WHOLE thing. so hopefully some info on it on this E3 that is all.
