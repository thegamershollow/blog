The possibility of a Nintendo Switch 2 is something that fans of the console have been wondering about for some time now. Recent rumors suggest that a second-generation Switch could arrive sometime in the second half of 2023. However, there is no official information on this yet, as Nintendo is famously tight-lipped about what it is working on.

The Nintendo Switch OLED, released in 2021, comes in at $349 / Â£309 / AU$539. A next-gen Switch would likely sit around that price point, especially if it makes use of an OLED display. On the display side, the Switch 2 may go for an OLED panel, much like that of the Switch OLED. It could also have a boost in refresh rates, taking the 60Hz display and boosting it to 120Hz.

When it comes to the Nintendo Switch 2's specs, we can expect Nintendo to stick with a system-on-a-chip from Nvidia, likely some next-generation take on the aged Tegra X1 chip found in the current Switch. There were murmurs of a potential co-processor chip to live in the dock of a Switch 2 or the once-rumored Nintendo Switch Pro. Such a feature would be neat, but rumors around it have fallen quiet.

Backward compatibility is expected to be included in the Switch 2, especially given the appetite we've seen for such capabilities on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. However, a new rumor has claimed that backwards compatibility for Switch games might not happen for the Switch 2. That would be a bit disappointing and would need Nintendo to have a stellar launch lineup for a next-gen Switch if it won't rely on its older and established game library.

Improving the Joy-Cons so they suffer less from potential stick drifting and have analog triggers for more precise control would be a welcome addition to the Switch 2. A boost in battery life would also be appreciated, as the Switch tends to run out of juice in a handful of hours when running games like Breath of the Wild.

There are no concrete hints about Nintendo Switch 2's features, but it is likely to work with existing Switch accessories like the Ring Fit Adventure and external controllers. Improving Wi-Fi connectivity could be an impressive upgrade the Switch 2 could bring to the table.

Overall, it is still early days for the Switch 2 rumors, with not a lot of hard and fast information floating around. However, the time is arguably nigh for a new and more powerful Switch or overall Nintendo console, and the Nintendo Switch 2 could be the answer. Nintendo fans will have to wait patiently for more official news on the matter.
