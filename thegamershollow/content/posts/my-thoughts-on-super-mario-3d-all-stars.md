 Today, i will be telling you my thoughts on Super Mario 3D all stars.

Super Mario 3D all Stars is a Super Mario 35th anniversary game that was released September 18th 2020 for 59.99 USD it was taken down march, 31st 2021, you can still find it in stores but it is very rare. it includes Super Mario 64, Super Mario Sunshine, and Super Mario Galaxy.   

  

**Super Mario 64**

For anyone who grew up with the wii or the n64 you will love this game while the camera is tricky to manage, it is a great debut of a 3d Mario game. while you cant play it 2 player, you can still have fun on your Mario adventure.

  

**Super Mario Sunshine**

For anyone who loves 3D Mario games with a twist this game is for you, just like the SM64 this game does not support 2 player, but in my opinion I think it would be harder to play it 2 player than it is to play a single player adventure. In my opinion this is the best 3D Mario game ever created, while the game is hard it is still fun to play.

  

  

**Super Mario Galaxy**

While the other games in the 3D all stars collection don't support multiplayer this one does. While I really wish you didn't have to use motion controles , it is still a fun game that you can play with your friends and family.

  

Do i think this game is going to be rereleased Yes, Yes i do think it will be rereleased but i think nintendo will sell the games separately at 19.99 USD.
