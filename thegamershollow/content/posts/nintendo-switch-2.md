The likelihood of a new Nintendo console, the Switch 2, and its potential release date isn't out of the question. But Nintendo has yet to make an official announcement, rumors suggest that a new console is in development, and the current Switch, despite being a best-seller, is behind in terms of power and features compared to its rivals, which has fueled speculation of a successor for many.

Historically, Nintendo has had a significant gap between console releases. The time period between the releases of the GameCube and the Wii, and between the Wii and Wii U, were both around six years. However, the time between the Wii U and the Switch was only five years, which was likely due to the Wii U's lackluster sales. I predict that the announcement of the Switch 2 could happen in 2023, with a release date in Spring or Fall of 2024 but recent leaks have shown that we could get it a lot sooner.

While the current Switch continues to sell well, it is struggling to run newer games, such as Pokemon, and is several generations behind its rivals in terms of power. A new console would not need to match the PS5 or Xbox Series X in power but would require an update to ease the technical burden on both third-party and first-party games. As most third-party titles run very bad on the current hardware.

In conclusion, while it is uncertain when the Switch 2 will be released, the current Switch's age and lack of power are compelling reasons for Nintendo to develop a successor. Nonetheless, given Nintendo's history, it could be a few years before the new console is officially announced, so consumers should temper their expectations in the meantime.
