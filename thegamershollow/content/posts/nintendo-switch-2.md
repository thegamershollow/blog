The likelihood of a new Nintendo console, the Switch 2, and its potential release date isn't out of the question. But Nintendo has yet to make an official announcement, rumors suggest that a new console is in development, and the current Switch, despite being a best-seller, is behind in terms of power and features compared to its rivals, which has fueled speculation of a successor for many.

Historically, Nintendo has had a significant gap between console releases. The time period between the releases of the GameCube and the Wii, and between the Wii and Wii U, were both around six years. However, the time between the Wii U and the Switch was only five years, which was likely due to the Wii U's lackluster sales. I predict that the announcement of the Switch 2 could happen in 2023, with a release date in Spring or Fall of 2024 but recent leaks have shown that we could get it a lot sooner.

While the current Switch continues to sell well, it is struggling to run newer games, such as Pokemon, and is several generations behind its rivals in terms of power. A new console would not need to match the PS5 or Xbox Series X in power but would require an update to ease the technical burden on both third-party and first-party games. As most third-party titles run very bad on the current hardware.

The Nintendo Switch OLED, released in 2021, comes in at $349 / Â£309 / AU$539. A next-gen Switch would likely sit around that price point, especially if it makes use of an OLED display. On the display side, the Switch 2 may go for an OLED panel, much like that of the Switch OLED. It could also have a boost in refresh rates, taking the 60Hz display and boosting it to 120Hz.

When it comes to the Nintendo Switch 2's specs, we can expect Nintendo to stick with a system-on-a-chip from Nvidia, likely some next-generation take on the aged Tegra X1 chip found in the current Switch. There were murmurs of a potential co-processor chip to live in the dock of a Switch 2 or the once-rumored Nintendo Switch Pro. Such a feature would be neat, but rumors around it have fallen quiet.

Backward compatibility is expected to be included in the Switch 2, especially given the appetite we've seen for such capabilities on the PS5 and Xbox Series X. However, a new rumor has claimed that backwards compatibility for Switch games might not happen for the Switch 2. That would be a bit disappointing and would need Nintendo to have a stellar launch lineup for a next-gen Switch if it won't rely on its older and established game library.

Improving the Joy-Cons so they suffer less from potential stick drifting and have analog triggers for more precise control would be a welcome addition to the Switch 2. A boost in battery life would also be appreciated, as the Switch tends to run out of juice in a handful of hours when running games like Breath of the Wild.

There are no concrete hints about Nintendo Switch 2's features, but it is likely to work with existing Switch accessories like the Ring Fit Adventure and external controllers. Improving Wi-Fi connectivity could be an impressive upgrade the Switch 2 could bring to the table.

Overall, it is still early days for the Switch 2 rumors, with not a lot of hard and fast information floating around. However, the time is arguably nigh for a new and more powerful Switch or overall Nintendo console, and the Nintendo Switch 2 could be the answer. Nintendo fans will have to wait patiently for more official news on the matter.

In conclusion, while it is uncertain when the Switch 2 will be released, the current Switch's age and lack of power are compelling reasons for Nintendo to develop a successor. Nonetheless, given Nintendo's history, it could be a few years before the new console is officially announced, so consumers should temper their expectations in the meantime.
