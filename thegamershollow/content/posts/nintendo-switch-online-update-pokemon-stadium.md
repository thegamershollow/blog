Nintendo fans have reason to celebrate, as one of the most beloved classic titles from the Nintendo 64 era is making its way to the Nintendo Switch Online service. Pokémon Stadium, the classic 3D battler and minigame collection, will be available to play on Wednesday, April 12th, 2023.

While this news has been long-awaited, it is not without a catch. As with all N64 games on the Switch Online service, players will need the expansion pack in order to play it. Furthermore, fans who were hoping for the ability to trade Pokémon with Pokémon Home will be disappointed to learn that this feature will not be included in the Switch Online version of the game. However, there is still much to be excited about.

One significant improvement that the Switch Online version of Pokémon Stadium will offer is four-player online multiplayer, allowing friends from all over to participate in classic games like Clefairy Says and Sushi-Go-Round together. This new feature adds a level of social interaction and excitement to the game that was not possible in its original release.

The addition of Pokémon Stadium to the Switch Online library is part of an ongoing effort by Nintendo to expand the service and offer fans a wider range of classic games to enjoy. In February of 2023, the Game Boy Advance library was added to the service, bringing with it titles such as The Legend of Zelda: The Minish Cap and Mario and Luigi: Superstar Saga. Metroid Fusion was added the following month, and the base tier of Switch Online received an update with a small handful of additional titles in March.

Overall, the Switch Online service has come a long way since its initial release, and the inclusion of Pokémon Stadium is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. While some may be disappointed by the lack of trading functionality, the addition of four-player online multiplayer is a major plus. Nintendo fans can look forward to enjoying classic titles like this and many others on the Switch Online service for years to come.
