Today we will be going over the latest Pokémon Direct, and the news and speculation on the games Scarlet and Violet. The Pokémon Company recently released a new 3 minuet trailer that went over more Scarlet and Violet news. It is speculated that there are going to be two separate time-lines, one in the past one in the future, and that is only more confirmed by the fact that in the trailer we see two different professors, witch only leads to more people speculating the separate time-lines. In other news from the trailer, you are able to connect with up to four people online or locally and adventure together but that is the only information we received about it, so we don’t really know how it is going to work. Scarlet and Violet look so close to Pokémon Arceus, but the catching mechanics do look to be different, we may have to encounter Pokémon instead of being able to catch multiple at once in the open world environment. With this new installment in the Pokémon franchise being so unique it has some new added benefits, you don’t have to follow a story drive path like all the other games, you can explore and go wherever you want, witch we know fans of the series have wanted for a long time. While the Pokémon Company has set a concrete release date of November 18th 2022, we shouldn’t get are hopes up that their won’t be delays, comment down below what you are hopeful for in this news series, what starter your picking, and witch version of the game your purchasing.
