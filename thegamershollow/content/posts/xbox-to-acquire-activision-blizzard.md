On January 18th, 2022, Microsoft announced that they would be acquiring Activision Blizzard for an all-out purchase of $68.7 billion USD. Phill Spencer (CEO of Xbox Game Studios; Microsoft Gaming) said in a tweet “Had good calls this week with leaders at Sony. I confirmed our intent to honor all existing agreements upon acquisition of Activision Blizzard and our desire to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation. Sony is an important part of our industry, and we value our relationship.”

 

Microsoft never planned on purchasing Activision Blizzard, but they saw a chance and took it. CEO of Activision Blizzard - Bobby Kotick said that “We expect the deal to go through some time by the end of Microsoft’s 2023 fiscal year ending in June.”. 

Activision, Blizzard is currently in ongoing litigation in regards to claims reporting a workplace culture that allegedly enabled acts of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination. After Microsoft acquires Activision Blizzard they plan on removing current CEO, Bobby Kotick.

Microsoft, acquiring Activision, Blizzard, is a big movement in the gaming industry, not only is it the biggest purchase ever made in the industry, Activision Blizzard is one of the biggest game development companies in the world, and with them having many of the biggest games e.g. Diablo, Overwatch, Call of Duty, and Destiny. These games are on many of the consoles and PlayStation fans will probably be scared the Xbox will take them away, but knowing how big these games are and how big their player bases are Xbox probably won't make them Xbox exclusives, but they will put them on Xbox Game pass (Their game subscription service.). 

Xbox’s main goal is game preservation, and being able to sit down and just play games. With things like Xbox Game Pass and XCloud (Xbox’s Cloud Gaming Service) all of that is possible. Xbox will probably go to Sony (The company that owns PlayStation) and say “you can keep Call of Duty on your console, if you allow us to put Xbox Game Pass. Now i don’t know if this will for sure happen but it is a possibility. When Xbox announced that they bought Bethesda, they said that most new games made by Bethesda would be Xbox exclusives for a limited time and then come to other consoles/pc. I don't think that is going to happen with Activision, I think Xbox is going to say to PlayStation and Nintendo, you can keep these games on your consoles if you let us put Xbox Game Pass on your console. If Xbox does end up doing that, it won't really affect the other companies that much it could actually benefit them, if someone wanted to buy a PS5 to play the exclusives but also wanted to be able to use console Game Pass on a next gen console they wouldn’t have to purchase multiple consoles witch would, one benefit the sales of other consoles, and two limit E-waste. 

In the end I'm not surprised that Microsoft/Xbox made this move, while yes they did spend a lot of money that they could have used for other things, it also will end up benefiting Activision Blizzard because they won’t have to worry about the problems that are currently going on in their workplace.
