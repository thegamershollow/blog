so I thought I would talk about this since 2021 marks the 35th anniversary of Zelda.

I will be talking about mostly breath of the wild 2 thoughts of what will be in the game. and a in-depth trailer review.

above is the official Nintendo trailer for The Legends Of Zelda Breath Of The Wild 2 (this was announced at E3 2019 and it is now January 2021.)

  

so looking at this trailer we see Zelda, Link, and Ganon as a Gerudo or what I think to be Ganon. we see the landscape of BOTW and we also see an underground part of what I am assuming is under hyrule castle. we do not see much else though so it is very hard to predict what is going to happen in the sequel. I am hoping that this is released in march kinda like how they did the Mario 35 thing. I also hope along with a sequel they release a Zelda all star game with all of the Zelda games on it except for BOTW and BOTW 2.  It is official they have given us info in their fiscal year game release dates pdf Here is an image(if you do not believe me then go to this pdf and scroll to the last page [Click Here to go to the pdf](https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2021/210506_3e.pdf)
